## 1. Branching on Github :star:
Often, we need to add features and functionalities to our existing programs. There is always a significant risk of breaking the current working solution while adding these features. Git provides a feature to develop and experiment with the new features before merging into the operational master branch. As similar to its name, a 'branch' is the parallel version of the repository development's mainline. As mentioned earlier, branches are mostly used to develop features, fix bugs, and experiment with new ideas.
In the below tutorial, we will cover both the command-line instructions and Web-UI instruction to perform tasks related to branching.

## - Creating a new branch 

For the web-application:
Once the repository is created, click on the name of the repository from the list ot go inside it. As provided below, click on the "master" option and an option will appear to find or create new branch. Add a name of the branch in the textbox and then click on the option below the textbox "Create branch: 'branchname' from masters". After clicking that option, you will be utomatically redirected into the intended branch.
