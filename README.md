What is this course about? An introductory course in the practical aspects of software quality. Validation of software throughout the life cycle. Comparative effectiveness in defect removal of formal methods (proofs of correctness), inspection (walkthroughs and reviews), and testing (unit, integration, and system testing; white box versus black box). The primary purpose of this course is to introduce the concepts, theory and practice of software quality assurance through testing, inspection, and measurement.

- **Textbook.** üìñ  Lectures plus a range of library and web resources (for the main course content). CISC 327 Course Readings‚Äîavailable at the Queen‚Äôs Bookstore [Optional].
