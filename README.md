What is this course about? An introductory course in the practical aspects of software quality. Validation of software throughout the life cycle. Comparative effectiveness in defect removal of formal methods (proofs of correctness), inspection (walkthroughs and reviews), and testing (unit, integration, and system testing; white box versus black box). The primary purpose of this course is to introduce the concepts, theory and practice of software quality assurance through testing, inspection, and measurement.

- **Textbook.** üìñ  Lectures plus a range of library and web resources (for the main course content). CISC 327 Course Readings‚Äîavailable at the Queen‚Äôs Bookstore [Optional].

- **Tutorials, laboratories and final exam.** üßØ There are no formal tutorials. There are no scheduled labs, but you will require significant team lab time outside class to carry out your project assignments. There is no final exam.

<h2 align="center"> Where to Ask a Question? :question: </h2> 
  
There is an `issues` tab right up there :point_up:. Cannot find it? Click <a href='https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/Assignment-Instructions/issues'>HERE</a>. To ask a question, follow two steps:
- Frist, search for related issue using the `Filters` box. 
- If no one asked before, create an issue with a title that summazie your whole question. Then fill in the body of your question. You can copy screenshot and parse into the text box as well.

### Git & GitHub Instruction. üèÑ 
In this course, all the assignments will be fully integrated with git and GitHub. Git is currently a common source code management solution used in the industrial. We will use git and GitHub for managing source code, running test cases, conducting code reviews, and managing documentations. Please go through the tutorial below throughoutly. 

- üëâ  [GitHub Basics for Assignment Submission](https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/Information/blob/master/github_basics.md)

<details><summary>:soon:  Week 2 (Sept 14) Software Process Evaluation, Extreme Programming</summary>
<p>

Software Process II: The Spiral model. The Iterative Development Process (IDP). The Object Oriented Development Process.

Software Process Evaluation: Software process improvement. The Defect Prevention Process (DPP). Software quality standards. Maturity models, CMM, SPR. Baldrige Quality Award, ISO 9000.

Extreme Programming I: What is XP? Why is it called extreme? Characteristics of XP. Addressing risks before they arise.

Study questions:
- List two advantages of the XP practice "On-site Customer".
- XP practice 4, "Simplicity", favours designing for today over accounting for future needs. How might this lead to wasted work?
- We talked a little about safety-critical systems like Therac-25. Do you think XP would be a good process model for safety-critical software? Why or why not?
