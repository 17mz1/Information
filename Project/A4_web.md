:ship: Course Project Assignment #4 - Full Implementations :ship: 

</h1>

In this assignment, you will design and rapidly program the second prototype of your team’s project,
**with features R4, R5, R6**, including both the frontend and the backend.
Likewise, the next assignment will involve writing your test code
for R4, R5, R6 from Assignment #1. So, **do not do full testing** of your project at this time.
Work together as a team on your program by utilizing Git branching, pull requests and code reviews. Also, try to use Pair
Programming to implement Frontend and Backend features in parallel.

Deliveries:
- A design document in PDF or preferably the markdown format for your project, giving the overall structure of your solution,
showing the classes and methods as a diagram or table, with a brief (one sentence) description of the intention of each.
- The second version of the source code to implement your design (including all features of R4, R5, R6).
- **Detail code review** for each pull request.


Submission: create a tag of on your GitHub repository (following our assignment submission insturction using git) and submit the following infomation to onQ.
- tag_name
- pull_request_links for team_member_1, number of pull-request reviews done by team_member_1
- pull_request_links for team_member_2, number of pull-request reviews done by team_member_2
- pull_request_links for team_member_3, number of pull-request reviews done by team_member_3
- pull_request_links for team_member_4, number of pull-request reviews done by team_member_4
  
  

Your solution to this assignment will be judged on the **clarity** and **readability** of the design and the code,
so work at using your best programming practices, including naming variables, classes and methods meaningfully,
and commenting liberally to make it easy for other programmers to understand.
Your solution to this assignment will not be judged on its correctness; rather, on the quality of its design and coding.
This is to be a rapid first version, not a final product. So, design and program it to work correctly, but don’t worry
about getting it fully tested or debugged yet, since that’s what you will do on the next assignment.

Marking: 

|  |  | 10 marks |
|--|--|------|
| Design  |  | 3 |
|  | Architecture |   |
|  | • clearly documents structure of solution |  |
|  | • explicitly describes intention of each class and method |  |
|  | • accurately reflects solution structure |  |
|  | • clearly shows where inputs and outputs fit in |  |
|  | Completeness |   |
|  | • evidently addresses all required functionality |  |
|  | • has considered all kinds of user inputs |  |
| Source Code |  | 4  |
|  | Structure and format |   |
|  | • code is structured and formatted such that architecture is clearly visible in code |  |
|  | • naming of classes and methods clearly reflect their role in the solution |  |
|  | • as little cloning or redundancy as possible | |
|  | Maintainability |   |
|  | • avoidance of coding tricks and hacks |  |
|  | • simplest solution possible, no frills and extras |  |
|  | • clearest solution possible, no gratuitous optimizations | |
|  | Internal documentation |  |
|  | • clear naming of all variables and constants to reflect their role in the solution |  |
|  | • comments for every class and method, clearly documenting their interface and intention | |
|  | • comment at beginning of main program, documenting | |
| Teamwork |  |  |
|  | All the updates to the repository have to go through pull-request. All the pull-request requires reviews from the team members.  | 3  |
